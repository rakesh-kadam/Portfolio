        <div class="description" >Pikachu (Japanese: ピカチュウ Hepburn: Pikachū, pronounced [pikatɕɯː], English: /ˈpiːkətʃuː/) are a species of Pokémon, fictional creatures that appear in an assortment of video games, animated television shows and movies, trading card games, and comic books licensed by The Pokémon Company, a Japanese corporation. They are yellow rodent-like creatures with powerful electrical abilities. In most vocalized appearances, including the anime and certain video games, they are primarily voiced by Ikue Ōtani. A Pikachu also appears as part of the main cast in the live-action animated film Pokémon Detective Pikachu, played in CGI and voiced by Ryan Reynolds.</div>
